	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08448},
	abstract = {This paper considers the optimal adaptive allocation of measurement effort for identifying the best among a finite set of options or designs. An experimenter sequentially chooses designs to measure and observes noisy signals of their quality with the goal of confidently identifying the best design after a small number of measurements. This paper proposes three simple and intuitive Bayesian algorithms for adaptively allocating measurement effort, and formalizes a sense in which these seemingly naive rules are the best possible. One proposal is top-two probability sampling, which computes the two designs with the highest posterior probability of being optimal, and then randomizes to select among these two. One is a variant of top-two sampling which considers not only the probability a design is optimal, but the expected amount by which its quality exceeds that of other designs. The final algorithm is a modified version of Thompson sampling that is tailored for identifying the best design. We prove that these simple algorithms satisfy a sharp optimality property. In a frequentist setting where the true quality of the designs is fixed, one hopes the posterior definitively identifies the optimal design, in the sense that that the posterior probability assigned to the event that some other design is optimal converges to zero as measurements are collected. We show that under the proposed algorithms this convergence occurs at an exponential rate, and the corresponding exponent is the best possible among all allocation},

After randomization, each patient receives up to four stages of chemotherapy, with the patient's disease evaluated after each stage and categorized on a trinary scale of severity. Therapy is continued to the next stage if the patient's disease is stable, and is discontinued if either tumour response or treatment failure is observed. We assume a probability model that accounts for baseline covariates and the multi-stage treatment and disease evaluation structure. The design uses covariate-adjusted adaptive randomization based on a score that combines the patient's probabilities of overall treatment success or failure. The adaptive randomization procedure generalizes the method proposed by Thompson (1933) for two binomial distributions with beta priors. A simulation study of the design in the context of the sarcoma trial is presented. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {A key component in controlling the spread of an epidemic is deciding where, when and to whom to apply an intervention. We develop a framework for using data to inform these decisions in realtime. We formalize a treatment allocation strategy as a sequence of functions, one per treatment period, that map up-to-date information on the spread of an infectious disease to a subset of locations where treatment should be allocated. An optimal allocation strategy optimizes some cumulative outcome, e.g. the number of uninfected locations, the geographic footprint of the disease or the cost of the epidemic. Estimation of an optimal allocation strategy for an emerging infectious disease is challenging because spatial proximity induces interference between locations, the number of possible allocations is exponential in the number of locations, and because disease dynamics and intervention effectiveness are unknown at outbreak. We derive a Bayesian on-line estimator of the optimal allocation strategy that combines simulation–optimization with Thompson sampling. The estimator proposed performs favourably in simulation experiments. This work is motivated by and illustrated using data on the spread of white nose syndrome, which is a highly fatal infectious disease devastating bat populations in North America.},

abstract = {Thompson Sampling (TS) is one of the oldest heuristics for multiarmed bandit problems. It is a randomized algorithm based on Bayesian ideas and has recently generated significant interest after several studies demonstrated that it has favorable empirical performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. In this article, a novel and almost tight martingale-based regret analysis for Thompson Sampling is presented. Our technique simultaneously yields both problem-dependent and problem-independent bounds: (1) the first near-optimal problem-independent bound of O(√ NT ln T) on the expected regret and (2) the optimal problem-dependent bound of (1 + ϵ)Σi ln T / d(μi,μ1) + O(N/ϵ2) on the expected regret (this bound was first proven by Kaufmann et al. (2012b)).Our technique is conceptually simple and easily extends to distributions other than the Beta distribution used in the original TS algorithm. For the version of TS that uses Gaussian priors, we prove a problem-independent bound of O(√ NT ln N) on the expected regret and show the optimality of this bound by providing a matching lower bound. This is the first lower bound on the performance of a natural version of Thompson Sampling that is away from the general lower bound of Ω (√ NT) for the multiarmed bandit problem.},

  abstract = 	 {Thompson sampling is one of the most widely used algorithms in many online decision problems due to its simplicity for implementation and superior empirical performance over other state-of-the-art methods. Despite its popularity and empirical success, it has remained an open problem whether Thompson sampling can achieve the minimax optimal regret O(\sqrt{TK}) for K-armed bandit problems, where T is the total time horizon. In this paper we fill this long open gap by proposing a new Thompson sampling algorithm called MOTS that adaptively truncates the sampling result of the chosen arm at each time step. We prove that this simple variant of Thompson sampling achieves the minimax optimal regret bound O(\sqrt{TK}) for finite time horizon T and also the asymptotic optimal regret bound when $T$ grows to infinity as well. This is the first time that the minimax optimality of multi-armed bandit problems has been attained by Thompson sampling type of algorithms.}
