\definition{High Probability Event $\hpeDP$ \cite{foster2020instance}}

Set $\mu_m = \frac{64 \log{4M/\delta}}{n_{m-1}}$ for all $m \in [M]$. 
Let $\delta$ be a fixed in the interval $(0, 1]$, and then define the event 
$\hpeDP$ as the event that for all $m \in [M]$

$$\hpeDP := \{2/3 \varrho \leq \widehat{\varrho} \leq 4/3 \varrho\}$$

$\hpeDP$ holds with probability at least $1 - \delta/2$
