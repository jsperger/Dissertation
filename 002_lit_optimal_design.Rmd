# Optimal Design

The word ``optimal'' is frequently encountered in the discussion of trial designs with a rich history going back until at least the pioneering work of Kirstine Smith in her 1918 dissertation \citep{smith1918standard}.



*Control over the context space*

*Deterministic rewards*

## Common Kinds of Optimality

$c$-optimality
$\min \log \text{det}\left(c^T(X^TX)^{-1}c\right)$

$c \in \mathbb{R}^d$

$d$-optimality

$\min \log \text{det}\left((X^TX)^{-1}\right)$



$g$-optimality

## Optimal Design in Clinical Trials

Atkinson

Elving Set

Barycentric Spanners

Geometric design

Very dependent on the shape of the function

When the response is a linear function of the parameters the optimal design puts the entirety of the observations
on the edges of the design space. 
When the response is a quadtratic function, the optimal design splits half of the observations between the edges of the design space and the other half is placed in the middle of the design space.
Christine Smith worked out the optimal design for polynomial functions up to degree six. The degree must be known in advance. The optimal design for a lower degree polynomial will not be optimal for higher degree polynomials; indeed it may not be estimable at all.
