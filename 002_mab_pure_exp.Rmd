## MAB Pure Exploration Problem

Without loss of generality assume that the maximum mean is unique and that its index is one $\mu^* = \mu_1$. Then an instance-dependent complexity measure $H$ based on the inverse gaps between the means for suboptimal arms and the optimal arm's mean is defined as:

$$H = \sum_{k =2}^{K} \frac{1}{(\mu_k - \mu^* )^2}$$

As the gap between arms grows smaller the complexity measure $H$ of the problem grows larger matching as one would expect. 

\cite{carpentier2016tight}

The probability that the best arm will be misidentified when there is a unique best arm is lower bounded by 

$$P(\widehat{a}_{T + 1} \neq a^*) \geq \exp{\left( - \frac{T}{H \log{K}} \right)}$$

Successive Rejection algorithm of \cite{audibert2010best} is optimal for the MAB best arm identification problem.
