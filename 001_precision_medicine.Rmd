# Precision Medicine

Precision medicine, and more recently precision health out of recognition for the broader applications
of these methods beyond clinical medicine, is a movement to formalize the long-standing practice of physicians
tailoring their treatments to the characteristics of their patients and the 
disease presentation. The goal is to improve the health of individuals and populations
by taking heterogeneity into account in an empirically-driven and statistically-sound way \citep{kosorok2015adaptive, kosorok2019precision}. The apex of this approach is decision support tools, and perhaps in the future,
automated decision making in appropriate contexts \citep{sperger2020future}.

The dynamic treatment regime (DTR) is perhaps the best known way to formalize the map from patient characteristics to 
potential treatments in Biostatistics, though it is also called an individualized treatment rule or a policy.
A DTR $\pi$ is a function, or set of functions, that maps
patients to treatments based on their covariates $\pi: \mcX \to \mcA$. The data available to base our decisions on
comes is assumed to come in the form of a triple $(X, A, Y)$ where $X$ is a vector denoting the patient's covariate information, $A$ the action taken, and $Y$ the response observed. Then the history at time $t$ $\mcH_t$ is a filtration that encapsulates all the complete data available $\mcH_t = \sigma\left((X_1, A_1, Y_1), \ldots, (X_t, A_t, Y_t)\right)$. Letting
$Y^*\left(\pi(X)\right)$ denote the potential outcome if a patient with covariates $X$ were treated according to DTR $\pi$,
the value of a DTR $\mcV(\pi)$ is defined as the expected value of assigning treatments according to the DTR:
$mcV(\pi) = \E_X[Y^*(\pi(X))]$. The statistical goal of precision medicine is to estimate an optimal DTR $\pi^*$ that maximizes the value function $\mcV(pi^*) \geq \mcV(\pi) \,\forall \pi \in \Pi$. We say an optimal DTR because there does not need to be a unique optimal DTR, though many authors may impose this assumption for simplicity.

## Estimation Methods

Estimation approaches for DTRs fall into two broad approaches: 1) the "direct" approach tries to optimize the estimated policy directly without estimating the relationship between treatment and response, and 2) the
"indirect" or regression-based approach which attempts to model the 
and then creates a DTR by selecting the treatment that maximizes the estimated expected response
