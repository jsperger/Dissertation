## Problem Definition 

We will now formalize the statement of the problem. At time $t = 1, \ldots [T]$ a new subject 
enters the study and we observe their covariate information encoded in a vector $x_t \in  \mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ where
$X_1, \ldots, X_2$ are independent and identically distributed random variables with context distribution $\mathcal{D}$. 
After this covariate information is observed, a treatment (arm, action) $a_t \in \mathcal{A}$ is assigned according to an assignment policy $\pi: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{H}_{t-1} \to \mathcal{A}$ where $\mathcal{H}_{t-1} = \left\{(x_1, a_1, r_1), \ldots, (x_{t - 1}, a_{t - 1}, r_{t -1})\right\}$ is the collected history of contexts, actions, and rewards through time $t-1$ with $\mathcal{H}_0 = null$
. The outcome (reward) $r_t \in [0,1]$ is immediately observed. The conditional expected reward is a fixed but unknown function of the covariate and treatment information $\E[r_t |x_t, a_t] = f(x_t, a_t)$. 



### Objective

Our goal will be to minimize the expected regret in the target population based on the estimated 
optimal policy $\widehat{\pi}_T$ at the conclusion of the study. This does not take into account any of the 
outcomes in the study except insofar as they influence the estimation of the optimal policy at the end of the trial.

$\mathrm{Reg}_{\text{pop}} = \E_{X, \pi}[f^*(\pi^*(x), x) - f^*(\widehat{\pi}_T(x), x)]$

### Assumptions


*Assumption - realizibility*

There exists $f^* \in \mathcal{F}$ s.t. $\E[Y | x_t, a_t] = f^*(x_t, a_t)$

*Assumption - rewards*

$Y_t = f^*(a_t, \pi_t) + \epsilon_t$

Where $\epsilon_t$ is a fixed but unknown distribution. Because $Y_t$ is bounded this implies
that $\epsilon_t$ has a sub-Gaussian distribution.

*Assumption - Function Class*

$|\mathcal{F}|$ is bounded

$\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{F})$ is bounded where $\mathrm{VC}$ is Vapnik-Chernis dimension

*Assumption - Oracle Access - Foster'20*

We assume that we have access to a solver

$\widehat{f}_m = \argmin_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \sum_{t = \tau_{m-1}}^{\tau_m - 1} \left(f(x_t, a_t) - r(x_t, a_t) \right)^2$
