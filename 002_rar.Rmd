# Response-adaptive Randomization

Response-adaptive randomization has a rich history in biostatistics and
statistics stretching back until at least the pioneering work of
\cite{thompson1933likelihood} which provided a heuristic algorithm that adjusts
the randomization probabilities so that they are proportional to the posterior
probability that arm is superior. To formalize the concept of response-adaptive
randomization, consider a clinical trial with $T$ patients and $K$ potential
treatments. An allocation or randomization sequence is a matrix $A = (A_1,
\ldots, A_n)$ where $A_i = e_k$ is a standard basis vector consisting of all
zeros except for a single one in the $k$-th position corresponding to the
treatment that the $i$-th individual received. Let $Y* = (Y_1^*, \ldots, Y_T^*)$
denote the $T \times K$ matrix of potential outcomes where $Y_i^*$ is the vector
of potential outcomes for individual $i$ if they were assigned each of the $K$
possible treatments. Naturally we only observe on element of $Y_i^*$, the one
corresponding to the assigned treatment. Again letting the history $\mcH_{t}
= \left((X_1, A_i, Y_i), \ldots, (X_{t - 1}, A_{t - 1}, Y_{t - 1}) \right)$ represent the
$\sigma$-field generated by the trial up to patient $t$. A randomization
procedure is then defined by the function $\phi_t = \E[A_t | \mcH_t, X_t]$ where
$\phi_t$ is $\mcH_t$ measurable.

\cite{hu2006theory} distinguish between five types of randomization procedures:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Complete randomization: $\phi_t = \E[A_t | \mcH_t] = \E[A_t]$
\item Restricted randomization $\phi_t = \E[A_t | \mcH_t] = \E[A_t | \mathcal{T}_t \subset \mcH_t]$
\item Response-adaptive randomization $\phi_t = \E[A_t | \mcH_t] = \E[A_t | (A_1, Y_1), \ldots, (A_{t-1}, Y_{t-1})]$
\item Covariate-adaptive randomization $\phi_t = \E[A_t | \mcH_t] = \E[A_t | X_1, \ldots, X_{t - 1}]$
\item Covariate-adjusted response-adaptive randomization $\phi_t = \E[A_t | \mcH_t] = \E[A_t | \mcH_t]$ 
\end{enumerate}

## Objectives

Maximize the expected outcomes

For a fixed power maximize the outcomes

Maximize power


## Controversies 
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) trial
\citep{bartlett1985extracorporeal} utilized a randomized play-the-winner design
that resulted in a single assignment to the control condition and eleven patients
assigned to ECMO.
